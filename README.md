## About The Project

As my final project for Stanford's Code in Place course, I decided to explore Steganography's Least Significant Bit Method - which makes it possible to hide messages in plain sight. After converting the user's text to binary values, the code then iterates over each pixel of the image, modifying the colour values of each pixels so as to hide the encrypted text

### Built With

* Python
* PIL library

## Acknowledgements
A special thank you to Dr Mehran Sahami and Chris Piech who made learning Python such a fun adventure, and to my section leader Juan Lamilla who provided so much guidance during the course.
